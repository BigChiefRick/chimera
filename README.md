# chimera# Chimera

A multi-cloud infrastructure discovery and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) generation tool that connects to multiple cloud and virtualization environments to automatically generate IaC templates from existing infrastructure.

## Overview

Chimera connects to your existing cloud and virtualization environments, discovers infrastructure resources, ingests metadata via APIs, and generates Infrastructure as Code templates. This enables you to:

- **Reverse Engineer Infrastructure** - Convert existing cloud resources into manageable IaC
- **Multi-Cloud Support** - Work across AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware vSphere, and KVM environments
- **Standardize Management** - Generate consistent IaC templates across different platforms
- **Accelerate Migration** - Quickly codify existing infrastructure for modernization efforts

## Supported Platforms

- ☁️ **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- ☁️ **Microsoft Azure**
- ☁️ **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- 🖥️ **VMware vSphere**
- 🖥️ **KVM/libvirt**

## Supported IaC Outputs

- Terraform (.tf)
- Pulumi
- AWS CloudFormation
- Azure ARM Templates
- *(More formats planned)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+ or Python 3.9+
- Valid credentials for target cloud/virtualization platforms
- Appropriate permissions for resource discovery in target environments

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/chimera.git
cd chimera

# Install dependencies (coming soon)
# go mod download
# OR
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Configure credentials (coming soon)
chimera configure

# Discover infrastructure
chimera discover --provider aws --region us-east-1

# Generate IaC templates
chimera generate --output terraform --target ./output/
```

## Configuration

Chimera supports multiple credential management approaches:
- Environment variables
- Cloud provider CLI profiles
- Configuration files
- Integration with HashiCorp Vault
- Cloud-native secret managers
